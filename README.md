# Project-Gamma

Welcome to the unnamed Project Gamma, a low poly 3d platformer where you play as 3 different characters, a cube, a sphere, and a pyramid, each with unique abilities. This game is a prototype for a larger project I will be making in the future. There will be a total of 27 levels (9 for each character), 3 bosses (1 for each character), and a hub world.

Currently working on:
  This project is on hold currently! I'm working on other projects now, and may return to this some day!
